### Hi! I'm Aldo Aditiya. 
### I'm currently doing my Masters in AI @ NUS.

#### For better or worse, I often Overthink the way we think. Which is probably why I end up doing Artificial Intelligence.

That is not the only thing I like though. I also write about psychology, economy, technology, systems, and the intersection between them.

Right now this web is pretty barebones. I'll add more from time to time.

Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zBxZFSaWZ8DIdKtqdHrzLR6DY4PildvG/view?usp=share_link), and my [github](https://github.com/Aldo-Aditiya/).
You can get in touch with me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldo-aditiya/).
