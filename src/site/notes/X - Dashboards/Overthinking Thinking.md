## Hi! I'm Aldo Aditiya. 
### I'm doing my Master's in AI @ NUS.
#### For better or worse, I often Overthink the way we think. Which is probably why I end up doing Artificial Intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence is not the only thing I like though. I also write about psychology, economy, technology, systems, and the intersection between them.

Right now this web is pretty barebones. I'll add more from time to time.

You can see my coding projects [here](https://github.com/Aldo-Aditiya/).
You can get in touch with me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldo-aditiya/).
